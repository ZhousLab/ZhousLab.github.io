Hi, I'm Zhou, currently a **PhD student** in National University of Singapore **(NUS)**, major in mechanical engineering. 

My research interests center on **dynamical system modeling** and **scientific machine learning**. At present, I'm actively engaged in leveraging advanced machine learning frameworks to model weather dynamics (AI4Weather), as well as improving the transparency of the AI-based model (XAI). I am convinced that fostering more **accurate** and **trustworthy machine-learning** practices contributes to the entire community.
